# What is it?

Just "microservice arch" into frontend. Why quotes? We have only one client per runtime, so it cannot be really segregated. 

For this purpose we can use single spa framework, which provides us configs for linking, bundling and running our separated React/Vue/Angular/Huynya_name framework and will be an entrypoint for our client. 

Haven't time and no need to configure by myself, "ta eshe ditch", so nahuy ego, I got the mind.
